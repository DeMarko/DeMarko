### Hi there 👋

I use `he/him` pronouns. I'm fluent in **English** and **Spanish**.

I currently work at [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) 💰🫂

Previously I worked at [SimpleContacts](https://simplecontacts.com/) 📱👁️

And before that I worked at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) 🌎🛍️🔨

🖥️ I **don't code in my free time**, so my GitHub repos are somewhat sparse.

💼 I'm currently **not looking for a job**. 

😄✊ You may be interested in [the union contract I helped write](https://kickstarterunited.org/first-contract/), hopefully it inspires your own collective bargaining agreements. If you are interested in unionizing your tech workplace, I'm happy to talk, feel free to find a way to contact me.

 🚫 If you are a recruiter contacting me for some reason, **don't**. I'm not interested in being your first, second, or even fifth engineer at a startup.
